# 8x8_matrix_toolbox

These are example and toolbox files to get you started with the 8x8 matrix module for RC2014. 

This module allows you to control a small 8 pixel by 8 pixel display. You can use it to display scrolling messages, patterns and animations, run John Conwayâ€™s Life and even play games! It is designed for the RC2014 and compatible computers, including the Jupiter Ace clone, Minstrel the Forth.

The assembly examples are designed to build with zasm and run on a RC2014 with CP/M or ROMWBW. They should build with other compilers with minimal or no adjustment.

A good starting point is 8x8-template, which handles the necessary multiplexing and gives you one simple callback where you can put your program loop. For starters It includes a smiley face, so you only need to build and run that to see a static image on the matrix display.

If you boot your RC2014 into BASIC, the hardware assembly instructions, which are included here (pdf) include some simple BASIC commands and code to test your display and get started.
